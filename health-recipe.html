        <ol>
            <strong><li>You must eat in order to doo doo. #<strong>faX</strong></li></strong>

                <li>Eat some meat</li>
                <li>Eat your greens (if you wanna stay regular ;])</li>
                <li>Only junk sometimes. Or you'll have problems</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong><li>Drink water. A lot and a lot of water. Had a girlfriend who had trouble pooing. Pretty sure it's cause she didn't drink water. -_-</li></strong>
            <br>
            <strong><li>Exercise. Exercise. Exercise. Your turds will move through your intestines like Mario on Rainbow Road.</li></strong>
            <br>
            <strong><li>Sleeping is super important. If you didn't read my "Recipe for Sleep" click on sleep in the Ingredients.</li></strong>
            <br>
            <strong><li>If you're stressed then your body is all tight. If you're happy then you're body is loose. My "Recipe for Happiness" is above too.</li></strong>
